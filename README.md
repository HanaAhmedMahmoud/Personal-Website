# **Personal Website**

## **Introduction**

This is my personal website, built using React and Node.js. I developed this project to showcase my skills and experience, leveraging what I learned during my time as a developer at SafelyHome.

## **Skills Learned**

- UI design and prototyping in Figma
- Frontend development with React and Next.js
- Styling with Tailwind CSS

## **Prototype**

Before development, I created prototypes in Figma to visualise the design and layout of my website. Below are images of the initial designs.

## **Process**

I first created a Next.js project (suprising amount of time to set it up!) then created the relevant pages in the source. Whilst programming up the prototypes, I had to make the decision if I wanted each page to be seperate or have one continous scrollable page.

## **Components created**

- Background (using tailwind blur and positioning to create a purple aura for the back of the webpage)
- Navigation bar (takes in a string to indicate which page user is on, dynamically updating on clicks)

## **Animations**

- Use of ternery operators and opacity to fade in and out boxes from the page - animated p tag?

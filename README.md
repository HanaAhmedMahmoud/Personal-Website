# **Personal Website**  

## **Introduction**  
This is my personal website, built using React and Node.js. I developed this project to showcase my skills and experience, leveraging what I learned during my time as a developer at SafelyHome.  

## **Skills Learned**  
- UI design and prototyping in Figma  
- Frontend development with React  
- Styling with Tailwind CSS  

## **Prototype**  
Before development, I created prototypes in Figma to visualise the design and layout of my website. Below are images of the initial designs.
